#CS 361: Project 1 (Deterministic Finite Automata)  
* Authors: Nicholas Merritt, Kai Sorensen
* Class: CS361 Section 001

## Overview
This program emulates a deterministic finite automata. Allowing users to create and test DFA's

## Reflection
One thing that stood out to me about this program the most was deciding which collection to use for storing the variables of the DFA. I'm used to working with a given set or hash or list etc. Choosing which one that we believed to work best took some consideration I'm not used to with these projects. It made it confusing at first how to work the TreeSet as we had never really used it before and we decided to use it for the DFA
