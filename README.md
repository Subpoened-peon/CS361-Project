#CS 361: Project 1 (Deterministic Finite Automata)  
* Authors: Nicholas Merritt, Kai Sorensen
* Class: CS361 Section 001
* Semester: Fall 2023

## Overview
This program emulates a deterministic finite automata. Allowing users to create and test DFA's

## Reflection
One thing that stood out to me about this program the most was deciding which collection to use for storing the variables of the DFA. I'm used to working with a given set or hash or list etc. Choosing which one that we believed to work best took some consideration I'm not used to with these projects. It made it confusing at first how to work the TreeSet as we had never really used it before and we decided to use it for the DFA.

If I could go back in time I would definitely tell myself not to overthink the DFAState class. It took a while for me to understand what exactly all we wanted it to accomplish. Though after filling out the project, we felt confident that it didn't require much more that what it inherited from the state class.

## Compiling and Using

To run this code, the user will want to find the directory containing the p1- files.
